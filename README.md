# **Alice's ring - Front End Application**

This front end application in react developed during the **ETHDenver 2023 hackathon** aims to offer you the possibility to interact with the different ring signature functionalities and to issue proof of solvency for different use cases.

## **Configuration** üìù

1. Clone this repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/KS-ETHDenver2023/Web_App-Alice_Ring.git
```
2. Install npm
```
npm install
```
3. Run
```
npm start
```

## **Structure**üìè

**1. Home page**

In this section you will learn more about our **Alice's ring project** and the "**proof of solvency**" that we can generate and issue thanks to ring signatures. There are many use cases and we have detailed some of them for you.

**2. Generate Proof of Solvancy**

Follow the steps on dedicated page.

**2. Check Proof of Solvancy**

Follow the steps on dedicated page.

**3. zkBob - Direct Deposit üí∏** 

Issuing **proof of solvency** is the first step before starting the anonymous transfer cycle. Indeed, after having attested to his solvency, the user may be required to transfer funds. 
But this step must not disclose its address and link it to its identity (see use cases).
**zkBob** gives you the freedom to deposit, transfer, and withdraw stable assets privately using **zk technology** paired with the BOB stablecoin. We have implemented the "Direct Deposit" feature and can find the smart contracts used in our dedicated Github repository.

In order to perform direct deposit actions via our smart contract, the user must first connect to our front end. Several wallets are available: **Metamask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet and Rainbow.**
*Currently BOB transfers are only available on **Polygon** mainnet and the **sepolia** testnet.*

**Perform direct deposit :**

In order to perform a direct deposit you have to  **approve + desposit**  some funds

1. First time : Approve Alice's ring DirectDeposit smart contract to transfer BOB

2. Other : Check Alice's ring allowance balance (increase if necessary) and desposited funds

3. Deposit BOB tokens into Alice's ring smart contract

4. Perform Direct Deposit

5. Come back here ‚ú®

**Generate a zkAddress to receive a transfer :**

If you are receiving funds from another zkBob user, you will want to send them a secure address. A new secure receiving address can be generated for each transfer.

Go to app.zkBob UI and click on  **Create ZkAccount**

1. Press the zkAccount button (your account should already be connected to initiate this process).

2. Press Generate receiving address.

3. Copy generated address and send to your friend via a private channel of your choice.

4. Come back here ‚ú®

## Technology üíª

 - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 - [Rainbowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/)
 - [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)
- [Infura RPC provider](https://www.infura.io/)
- [zkBob ](https://www.zkbob.com/)
- [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/)

Thanks to the large number of chains supported, we first used infura's RPCs for Polygon and Ethereum networks (mainnet&testnet).
The infura and truffle tools were also useful for the deployment of multi-chain smart contracts.
For Scroll and zkSync networks we used the RPCs provided in their respective documentations.  
We used Covalent solution and API to generate the anonymity set used for the ring signature implementation.

## Supported networks üõ∞Ô∏è

Currently, our application supports several networks but not all of them can be used for the same functionalities.

**Proof of Solvancy :**  
Mainnet (in development) : 
* [Polygon ](https://www.polygon.technology/)
* [Scroll ](https://scroll.io/)
* [zkSync ](https://zksync.io/)

Testnet (live) : 
* Polygon mumbai
* Scroll L1 testnet
* zkSync testnet
* Goerli

**zkBob - Direct Deposit :**

Due to zkBob choices, Direct Deposits can only be performed :

Mainnet (in development) : 
* [Polygon ](https://www.polygon.technology/)

Testnet (live) :
* Sepolia
